Here’s a clean and professional **README.md** for your Smart Energy Orchestration project — it explains everything clearly for SIH judges or GitHub presentation 👇

# ⚡ Smart Energy Orchestration System

A data-driven, software-centric solution for optimizing renewable energy utilization across public-sector campuses — integrating **solar**, **wind**, **battery**, and **grid** resources into a unified intelligent dashboard.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Many institutes have installed solar panels and wind turbines but still depend heavily on grid power due to poor coordination between these sources.
Existing systems work in isolation, lack predictive insights, and require manual monitoring — leading to inefficiency and higher costs.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We developed a **Smart Energy Orchestration Platform** that acts as a **virtual power plant (VPP)** — integrating all energy resources via software intelligence.
It uses **machine learning** to forecast demand and renewable generation, and **reinforcement learning** to optimize battery charging/discharging and load scheduling in real time.

### 🧠 Key Features

* Real-time monitoring of solar, wind, battery, and grid power
* Predictive analytics for next-hour/day energy demand and production
* RL-based decision engine for cost/emission optimization
* Interactive React dashboard with live visualization
* Vendor-neutral data layer using REST APIs / MQTT for sensor integration
* Carbon footprint and savings report generation

## 🧩 Components

### 1. React Dashboard (`/frontend`)

* Displays live energy generation and usage
* Graphs for solar, wind, battery, and grid metrics
* Insights section for predictions and optimization advice

### 2. ML Model (`/models/ml_model.py`)

* Uses regression to forecast next-hour energy generation and demand
* Trained on simulated or historical time-series data

### 3. RL Model (`/models/rl_agent.py`)

* Reinforcement learning agent (e.g., DQN) to schedule battery charging/discharging
* Objective: minimize grid dependence and maximize renewable self-consumption

### 4. Backend API (`/backend/app.py`)

* Serves predictions to the dashboard
* Connects to sensors / simulated data sources
* Stores historical data for analytics

Would you like me to make this README **more visually rich** (with badges, emojis, and better formatting for GitHub presentation)? It’ll look stunning for submission.
